# to-vue-or-not-to-vue

Single Page Application (SPA)
- Only a single HTML page sent (initially) to the browser
- Vue intercepts subsequent requests and handles "page" changes in the browser by swapping what components are shown on the page
- Results in a much faster and smoother website experience

## Vue documentation and link to use in code.
Vue docs: https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html

You can use Vue directly from a CDN via a script tag:
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.0.2"></script>

### Notes from class:
Mounting means putting elements into the DOM. 
DOM stands for Document Object Model. The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.

To make it simple, mounted means the component has been loaded to the DOM and unmounted means the components has been removed from the DOM.

v-on is called a directive

this. references the component itself

Generally adding and removing from the DOM is more expensive and time consuming. Than hiding and showing in CSS. v-show uses CSS, while v-if adds to the DOM

@ is shortcut for v-on, : is shortcut for bind:

list-style-type: none; is to make the bullet points disappear from a list

attribute binding tells the page to use the element listed in the jvscript

he's got a separate whole class just over flex!
